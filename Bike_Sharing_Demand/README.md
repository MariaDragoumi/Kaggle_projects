In this project the goal was to forecast the use of a city bikeshare system. The main target was to use exploratory analysis to create a feature engineer pipline to transform the non-linear relation between the target and the data, in order to use Linear Regresion Model. 
The correlation of each feature to the target is calculated and its relation visualized to grasp the proper transformation. Moreover, it was found that interaction terms are needed to capture the complex connection between hourly rentals for working and non-working days.
